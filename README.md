## **Solution Architecture**

The solution architecture is designed to ensure scalability, interactivity, and data persistence. The key components and their respective technologies are as follows:

### **Frontend:**
- Built using **React (v19.0.0)** and styled components for a modern, dynamic, and interactive user interface.  
- Utilizes libraries like **react-router-dom** for seamless navigation and **react-icons** for rich visual enhancements.

### **State Management:**
- Centralized and efficient state management using **@reduxjs/toolkit (v2.5.1)** for application logic and local storage for persistent user settings.  
- **localforage (v1.10.0)** ensures offline data storage and synchronization, enabling data persistence even when the user is offline.

### **File System Simulation:**
- Simulates a virtual file system within the browser, allowing users to create, delete, and rename files and folders.  
- Secure storage is achieved using **crypto-js (v4.2.0)** for encrypting file contents and ensuring data security.

### **User Profiles:**
- Supports multiple user profiles, each with personalized settings, preferences, and data storage.  
- Profile data is maintained persistently across sessions using local storage and in-memory mechanisms.

### **Additional Enhancements:**
- **Interactive Desktop Environment:** Powered by **react-dnd** and **react-rnd** for draggable icons and resizable application windows.  
- **Visual Enhancements:** Enriched using Font Awesome and **React Icons** to provide a sleek, modern interface.

These components work together to create a desktop environment that is highly interactive, secure, and user-friendly.
